In this repository, you will find an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard displays following, based on the Test Subject ID selected by the user:
1. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information
2. Horizontal Bar Chart - Displays the top 10 OTUs found in the individual
3. Gauge Chart - Displays the frequency data from demographic data
4. Bubble Chart - Displays OTU IDs and Sample Values for the individual
